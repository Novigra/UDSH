# UDSH - Utility Dialogue System Hamo (WIP)
It's a screenwriting software. I'm still working on it, but it's mostly functional if you want to test it.

## Important Note:
Keep in mind, the latest updates are in the dev branch. The main branch is for the app executable, but work is still in progress so for now, you will need to build the project to launch the app! :)
